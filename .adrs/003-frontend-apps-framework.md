# ADR 003: Frontend Apps Framework

## Context

We need to select a framework for building frontend applications in our monorepo that:

- Supports React (our chosen UI library)
- Provides server-side rendering and routing capabilities
- Integrates well with our monorepo structure
- Has strong ecosystem support and tooling
- Enables fast development and prototyping

## Considered Options

### Option A – Next.js

Full-stack React framework with file-based routing.

**Pros**

- Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation and community support
- Excellent integration with React Server Components
- Strong TypeScript support out of the box
- Built-in optimizations (image optimization, font optimization, etc.)
- File-based routing that's intuitive and easy to understand
- Hot module replacement and fast refresh
- Turbopack for faster builds and development
- Battle-tested in production at scale
- Strong deployment options (Vercel, self-hosted, etc.)
- Works seamlessly with Turbo and pnpm workspaces
- Easy to share components and utilities across apps

**Cons**

- Larger bundle size compared to minimal frameworks
- Some opinionated patterns that may not fit all use cases
- Learning curve for React Server Components and App Router

### Option B – TanStack Start

Full-stack React framework with file-based routing and streaming SSR, built by the TanStack team.

**Pros**

- Streaming SSR capabilities with excellent performance
- Modern React patterns and hooks-first approach
- File-based routing similar to Next.js
- Built on Vite for fast development and builds
- Strong TypeScript support
- Flexible and unopinionated architecture
- Excellent developer experience with TanStack Router integration
- Lightweight compared to Next.js
- Good integration with TanStack ecosystem (Query, Router, etc.)
- Built-in support for React Server Components
- Progressive enhancement and streaming capabilities

**Cons**

- Newer framework with smaller ecosystem compared to Next.js
- Less community resources, documentation, and examples
- Fewer third-party integrations and plugins
- Team familiarity with Next.js may require learning curve
- Next.js has more mature tooling and IDE support
- Better integration with design tools and prototyping platforms in Next.js
- Less battle-tested at scale compared to Next.js
- Fewer deployment options and hosting integrations

### Option C – Remix

Full-stack React framework with data loading patterns.

**Pros**

- Strong data loading patterns
- Good developer experience
- Full-stack capabilities

**Cons**

- Remix's data loading patterns are different from Next.js
- Team preference for Next.js's approach to data fetching
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Next.js
- Fewer integrations with design tools and prototyping platforms

### Option D – Vite + React Router

Build tool with client-side routing.

**Pros**

- Fast development server
- Flexible routing
- Good build performance

**Cons**

- Next.js provides built-in API routes and server-side rendering
- Less setup required for full-stack applications with Next.js
- Next.js includes many optimizations out of the box
- Better support for modern React features (Server Components, etc.)

## Decision

We will use **Next.js** as our frontend framework for applications.

**Main reasons:**

- Mature ecosystem with extensive documentation and community support
- Excellent integration with React Server Components and strong TypeScript support
- Built-in optimizations (image, font, etc.) and Turbopack for faster development
- Battle-tested in production at scale with strong deployment options
- Works seamlessly with Turbo and pnpm workspaces for monorepo integration

## Notes

- TanStack Start may be reconsidered for specific use cases that benefit from its streaming SSR capabilities
- Next.js continues to evolve rapidly with new features and optimizations
- Consider framework-agnostic patterns when building shared components
