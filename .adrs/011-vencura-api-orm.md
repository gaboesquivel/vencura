# ADR 011: Vencura API ORM Selection

## Context

We need to select an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for the Vencura API to interact with PostgreSQL databases. The tool must support:

- Type-safe database queries with full TypeScript support
- PostgreSQL compatibility (Cloud SQL and PGLite)
- Declarative schema definitions
- Database migrations
- Integration with NestJS framework
- Support for both embedded (PGLite) and cloud (Cloud SQL) databases
- Lightweight runtime overhead
- Good developer experience with IDE autocomplete
- Active community and maintenance

## Considered Options

### Option A – Drizzle ORM

Lightweight, type-safe ORM with a focus on SQL-like syntax and minimal abstraction.

**Pros**

- Excellent TypeScript support with full type inference
- Lightweight runtime with minimal overhead
- SQL-like syntax that's intuitive and familiar
- No code generation required (pure TypeScript)
- Supports both PGLite and PostgreSQL seamlessly
- Declarative schema definitions with type safety
- Built-in migration tooling (drizzle-kit)
- Composable query builder with excellent autocomplete
- Small bundle size
- Active development and growing community
- Works well with both embedded and cloud databases
- No runtime overhead from code generation
- Easy to test and mock

**Cons**

- Smaller ecosystem compared to Prisma
- Less mature than TypeORM (but rapidly growing)
- Requires more manual SQL knowledge compared to Prisma
- Migration tooling less feature-rich than Prisma
- Smaller community compared to established ORMs

### Option B – Prisma

Modern ORM with a focus on developer experience and type safety.

**Pros**

- Excellent developer experience with Prisma Studio
- Strong type safety with generated types
- Comprehensive migration system
- Large ecosystem and community
- Great documentation and learning resources
- Built-in query optimization
- Support for multiple databases
- Active development and strong backing
- Excellent IDE support with Prisma extension

**Cons**

- Code generation step required (build-time overhead)
- Runtime overhead from generated client
- Less flexible for complex queries
- Heavier bundle size
- Requires separate Prisma Client generation
- PGLite support may be limited or require workarounds
- More abstraction from SQL (can be pro or con)
- Migration system can be complex for advanced use cases

### Option C – TypeORM

Mature, feature-rich ORM with decorator-based entity definitions.

**Pros**

- Mature and battle-tested platform
- Large ecosystem and community
- Decorator-based syntax (familiar to NestJS developers)
- Active Record and Data Mapper patterns
- Comprehensive feature set (relations, transactions, etc.)
- Good documentation
- Supports multiple databases
- Well-integrated with NestJS

**Cons**

- Heavier runtime overhead
- More complex API surface
- Decorator-based approach can be verbose
- Type safety not as strong as Drizzle or Prisma
- Larger bundle size
- PGLite support may require custom adapters
- More abstraction can hide SQL complexity
- Slower query performance compared to lighter ORMs
- Migration system can be cumbersome

### Option D – Kysely

Type-safe SQL query builder (not a full ORM).

**Pros**

- Excellent TypeScript support with type inference
- SQL-like syntax with full type safety
- Lightweight with minimal runtime overhead
- No code generation required
- Compile-time query validation
- Very close to raw SQL (minimal abstraction)
- Small bundle size
- Good performance

**Cons**

- Not a full ORM (no built-in migrations, relations management)
- Requires more manual work for common patterns
- Less developer-friendly for complex relationships
- Smaller ecosystem
- No built-in migration tooling
- Requires more SQL knowledge
- Less abstraction (can be pro or con)
- PGLite support may require custom work

### Option E – Sequelize

Mature ORM with promise-based API.

**Pros**

- Mature and stable platform
- Large community and ecosystem
- Promise-based API (modern async/await)
- Supports multiple databases
- Good documentation
- Established patterns

**Cons**

- Less type safety compared to modern TypeScript ORMs
- Heavier runtime overhead
- More verbose syntax
- Older architecture (less modern patterns)
- PGLite support limited
- Less active development compared to newer ORMs
- TypeScript support not as strong as newer options

### Option F – MikroORM

TypeScript ORM with Data Mapper, Unit of Work, and Identity Map patterns.

**Pros**

- Strong TypeScript support
- Modern architecture with Unit of Work pattern
- Good type safety
- Supports multiple databases
- Active development
- Good documentation

**Cons**

- Smaller community compared to Prisma/TypeORM
- Steeper learning curve
- More complex API
- PGLite support may be limited
- Heavier than Drizzle
- Less familiar to most developers

## Decision

We will use **Drizzle ORM** for database operations in the Vencura API.

**Main reasons:**

- Excellent TypeScript support with full type inference aligns with our type-safe codebase
- Lightweight runtime with minimal overhead, important for Cloud Run deployments
- Seamless support for both PGLite (ephemeral PR deployments) and PostgreSQL (dev/prod)
- SQL-like syntax is intuitive and provides good control over queries
- No code generation required, reducing build complexity
- Declarative schema definitions with type safety enable maintainable database code
- Built-in migration tooling (drizzle-kit) provides necessary migration support
- Small bundle size reduces deployment size and cold start times
- Composable query builder with excellent IDE autocomplete improves developer experience
- Active development and growing community ensure long-term support
- Works well with NestJS dependency injection patterns

## Implementation Details

### Schema Definition

Schemas are defined using Drizzle's declarative syntax in `src/database/schema/`:

```typescript
import { pgTable, text, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const users = pgTable("users", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  email: text("email").notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
});
```

### Database Module

Drizzle is integrated with NestJS through a global `DatabaseModule` that provides:

- Database connection (supports both PGLite and PostgreSQL)
- Drizzle instance with schema
- Schema exports for type inference

### Migrations

Migrations are generated and managed using `drizzle-kit`:

- `db:generate` - Generate migration files from schema changes
- `db:migrate` - Apply migrations to database

### Query Patterns

Queries use Drizzle's composable query builder:

- Type-safe select, insert, update, delete operations
- Full TypeScript inference for results
- SQL-like syntax with excellent autocomplete

## Notes

- Schema files live in `src/database/schema/` directory
- Migrations are stored in `src/database/migrations/`
- Drizzle configuration in `drizzle.config.ts`
- Supports both PGLite (embedded) and Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Type inference works seamlessly across both database types
- Queries are composable and type-safe at compile time
- No runtime code generation required
- Regular schema reviews and migrations as requirements evolve
