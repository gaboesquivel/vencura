# Information Architecture

## Overview
Optimize information architecture following best practices to reduce cognitive load and improve discoverability. Restructure file names, directory hierarchies, content organization, and documentation for clarity and flow while preserving all information.

## Steps
1. **Analyze Current Structure**: Map existing file/directory organization, identify naming inconsistencies/conflicts, find duplicated/fragmented information, assess navigation paths/discoverability
2. **Design Improved Architecture**: Group related content logically by feature/domain, apply consistent naming conventions (lowercase-with-dashes), create clear hierarchies (max 3-4 levels deep), reduce redundancy through consolidation/references
3. **Optimize Content Flow**: Order information by frequency of use/complexity, front-load critical information, use progressive disclosure for complex topics, apply clear headings/scannable structure
4. **Refactor Implementation**: Rename files/directories with descriptive/predictable names, restructure hierarchies for intuitive navigation, update cross-references/imports, consolidate duplicate content

## Checklist
- [ ] Mapped current file/directory structure
- [ ] Identified naming inconsistencies and conflicts
- [ ] Found duplicated or fragmented information
- [ ] Designed logical groupings by feature/domain
- [ ] Applied consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Created clear hierarchies (max 3-4 levels)
- [ ] Ordered content by frequency and complexity
- [ ] Front-loaded critical information
- [ ] Renamed files/directories with descriptive names
- [ ] Updated cross-references and imports
- [ ] Consolidated duplicate content
- [ ] Verified improved discoverability

## What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't nest directories more than 3-4 levels deep
- ❌ Don't duplicate information across multiple files
- ❌ Don't lose information during restructuring
