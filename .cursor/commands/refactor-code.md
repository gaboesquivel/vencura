# Refactor Code

## Overview
Refactor selected code to improve quality while maintaining same functionality, providing refactored code with explanations.

## Steps
1. **Code Quality**: Extract reusable functions/components, eliminate duplication, improve naming, simplify complex logic/reduce nesting
2. **Performance**: Identify/fix bottlenecks, optimize algorithms/data structures, reduce unnecessary computations, improve memory usage
3. **Maintainability**: Make code readable/self-documenting, add appropriate comments, follow SOLID principles/design patterns, improve error handling/edge case coverage

## Checklist
