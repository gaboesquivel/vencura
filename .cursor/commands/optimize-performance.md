# Optimize Performance

## Overview
Analyze current code for performance bottlenecks and provide optimization recommendations, focusing on measurable improvements while maintaining code quality/readability.

## Steps
1. **Performance Analysis**: Identify slow algorithms/inefficient data structures, find memory leaks/excessive allocations, detect unnecessary computations/redundant operations, analyze database queries/API calls
2. **Optimization Strategies**: Suggest algorithm improvements/better data structures, recommend caching strategies, propose lazy loading/pagination, identify parallel processing opportunities
3. **Implementation**: Provide optimized code with explanations, include performance impact estimates, suggest profiling/monitoring approaches, consider performance/maintainability trade-offs
