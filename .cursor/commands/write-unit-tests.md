# Write Unit Tests

## Overview
Create comprehensive unit tests for current code with proper imports/setup per project testing conventions.

## Steps
1. **Test Coverage**: Test all public methods/functions, cover edge cases/error conditions, test positive/negative scenarios, aim for high coverage
2. **Test Structure**: Use project's testing framework conventions, write clear descriptive test names, follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern, group related tests logically
3. **Test Cases**: Happy path scenarios, edge cases/boundary conditions, error handling/exception cases, mock external dependencies appropriately
4. **Test Quality**: Make tests independent/isolated, ensure deterministic/repeatable, keep simple/focused, add helpful assertion messages
