# Run All Tests and Fix Failures

## Overview
Execute full test suite and systematically fix any failures, ensuring code quality and functionality.

## Steps
1. **Run test suite**: Execute all tests in project, capture output/identify failures, check both unit and integration tests
2. **Analyze failures**: Categorize by type (flaky, broken, new failures), prioritize fixes based on impact, check if failures related to recent changes
3. **Fix issues systematically**: Start with most critical failures, fix one issue at a time, re-run tests after each fix

## Checklist
- [ ] Full test suite executed
- [ ] Failures categorized and tracked
- [ ] Root causes resolved
- [ ] Tests re-run with passing results
- [ ] Follow-up improvements noted
