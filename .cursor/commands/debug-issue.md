# Debug Issue

## Overview
Help debug current issue by walking through debugging process systematically and providing clear, actionable solutions.

## Steps
1. **Problem Analysis**: Identify specific problem/error, understand expected vs actual behavior, trace execution flow to find root cause
2. **Debugging Strategy**: Add appropriate logging statements, suggest debugging tools/techniques, identify key variables/states to monitor, recommend breakpoint locations
3. **Solution Approach**: Propose potential fixes with explanations, consider multiple solution approaches, evaluate trade-offs, provide step-by-step resolution plan
4. **Prevention**: Suggest ways to prevent similar issues, recommend additional tests/checks, identify code patterns that could be improved
