# Add Documentation

## Overview
Add comprehensive documentation for current code/feature per project standards (README, apps/docu website, or inline comments).

## Steps
1. **Overview**: What code/feature does, why it exists, key concepts/terminology
2. **API Documentation**: Function/method signatures, parameters/return values, example usage, error handling/edge cases
3. **Implementation Details**: Architecture overview, important design decisions, dependencies/integrations
4. **Examples**: Common use cases with full examples, best practices/patterns, common pitfalls
