# General Agent Rules

## Code Quality
- Organize code logically with related functionality grouped together, aka "collocation"
- Always enforce type inference - define return types in functions, never in consumers

## Agent Behavior
- Provide concise executive summaries when finishing tasks
- Suggest improvements proactively when spotting issues
- Always read readme files before coding
- Always run `pnpm run qa` at the root of the monorepo to verify it all works
- Always update readme files after making code changes

## Stack
- Always prefer on Zod based solutions, unless a good for not using it
- Prefer importing types from `@vencura/core` over `@vencura/types` when types are re-exported (e.g., `ChainType`, `Wallet`, etc.). Schema imports should continue to use `@vencura/types/schemas` since schemas are not re-exported from `@vencura/core`
