# General Agent Rules

## Code Quality
- Organize code logically with related functionality grouped together (collocation)
- Avoid leaking server-only code into client bundles (no fs, path, env loaders in shared/browser code)

## Module System
- Use **ESM** everywhere (`"type": "module"`, `import` / `export`)
- Next.js apps use **bundler-style resolution**
- Elysia / server code use **Node-style resolution**
- Shared packages must be built and consumed via `package.json` **exports** (never import TS source across workspaces)

## Agent Behavior
- Provide concise executive summaries when finishing tasks
- Suggest improvements proactively when spotting issues
- Always read readme files before coding
- Always update readme files after making code changes

## Tooling
- Use **bun** for package management and scripts
- Format with `bun run format` (Biome)
- Lint with `bun run lint` (ESLint)
