# General Agent Rules

## Code Quality
- Organize code logically with related functionality grouped together, aka "collocation"

## Agent Behavior
- Provide concise executive summaries when finishing tasks
- Suggest improvements proactively when spotting issues
- Always read readme files before coding
- Always update readme files after making code changes

## Tooling
- Use **bun** for package management (not pnpm, npm, or yarn)
- Run `bun run format` to format code (uses Biome), `bun run lint` to lint code (uses ESLint)
