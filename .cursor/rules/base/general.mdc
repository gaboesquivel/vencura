# General Agent Rules

## Agent Behavior
- Read readme/docs/skills/rules before planning/coding; summarize assumptions in 3–5 bullets
- Update docs/rules after code changes
- Full workspace access: read/write/create/move/delete without asking
- Never ask before modifying files (including dotfiles)
- Provide concise summaries when finishing
- Suggest improvements proactively

## Information Priority
1. **Repository rules/skills** (`.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/skills/`) - Highest priority
2. **Indexed docs** (Cursor settings) - Advisory only, never override repo rules
3. **General knowledge** - Lowest priority, verify against repo patterns

**Principle**: Repo rules/skills > Indexed docs > General knowledge

## Context Management
- Search first (Grep/Glob), read later
- Targeted reads over broad exploration
- Start fresh for new features
- Use @ references strategically

## Tool Usage
- Maximize parallel calls (batch file reads/searches)
- Prefer Read/Write/StrReplace over shell commands
- Grep for symbols, Task(explore) for flows, Glob for patterns

## Planning & Execution
- Use TodoWrite for 3+ step tasks
- Define success criteria upfront
- Iterate: Implement → verify → fix until clean
- Revert/replan if stuck

## Code Quality
- Collocate related functionality
- No server-only code in client bundles (no fs/path/env in shared/browser code)
- Follow linting rules in generated code (see @.cursor/rules/base/linting.mdc)
- Search for existing functionality before creating new

## Safety & Boundaries
- Never commit secrets (warn on .env/credentials requests)
- Respect Ask mode restrictions (read-only)
- Verify before destructive operations
- Defer to user for ambiguous/high-risk decisions

## Communication
- Make changes directly (don't just suggest)
- Minimize meta-commentary
- Communicate blockers clearly
