# General Agent Rules

## Code Quality
- Organize code logically with related functionality grouped together, aka "collocation"

## Agent Behavior
- Provide concise executive summaries when finishing tasks
- Suggest improvements proactively when spotting issues
- Always read readme files before coding
- Always update readme files after making code changes
- Always run format, lint and test to verify changes work

## Tooling
- Use **bun** for package management (not pnpm, npm, or yarn)
- Use **eslint + prettier** for linting and formatting
- Run `bun run format` to format code, `bun run lint` to lint code
