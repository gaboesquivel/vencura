# TypeScript Rules

## Core Principles
- Prefer interfaces over types for object definitions
- Avoid enums; use maps or union types instead
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Follow the RORO (Receive an Object, Return an Object) pattern for function arguments and return values
- Use lowercase-with-dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`)
- Favor named exports for components
- Use functional & declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals, especially for single-line statements
- Infer types and keep them inline unless you need to reuse them

## Error Handling
- Fail fast: Handle errors early using guard clauses & early returns
- Place the happy path last for improved readability
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; prefer `if-return` pattern
- Throw errors from `@repo/errors` for consistency

## File Structure & Organization
Maintain a structured and logical order when organizing files:
1. Main Component – The primary component that orchestrates logic and renders subcomponents
2. Subcomponents – Smaller, reusable components that support the main component
3. Helpers & Utilities – Functions or modules that provide reusable logic and utilities
4. Static Content – Non-code assets such as constants, images, or localization files
5. Types & Interfaces – Type definitions for TypeScript to ensure type safety and maintain consistency
