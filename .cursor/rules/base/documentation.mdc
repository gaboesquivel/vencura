# Documentation Standards

## Writing Principles
- **Simple**: Get to the point quickly
- **Succinct**: No unnecessary words or fluff
- **Technical**: Assume the reader is a developer
- **Factual**: Describe what things do, not philosophies or paradigms

## Content Structure
- **Start with most important information first**: Lead with what matters most
- **Use clear headings and hierarchy**: Create scannable, well-structured content
- **Each page has a clear purpose**: Avoid overlap and redundancy
- **Link to related pages at the end**: Help readers navigate to adjacent topics
- **Optimize for flow and navigation**: Arrange content logically for progressive understanding

## Technical Writing Best Practices

### Clarity and Precision
- **Use active voice**: "Run the command" not "The command should be run"
- **Be specific**: "Supports PostgreSQL 14+" not "Supports PostgreSQL"
- **Avoid ambiguity**: Use concrete examples instead of vague descriptions
- **Define terms once**: First mention should include a clear definition
- **Use consistent terminology**: Pick one term and stick with it

### Structure and Organization
- **Inverted pyramid**: Most important information first, details later
- **One concept per section**: Don't mix multiple topics
- **Logical flow**: Each section should build on previous ones
- **Scannable content**: Use lists, tables, and code blocks
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity gradually

### Code Examples
- **Minimal but complete**: Show only what's necessary, but ensure it works
- **Inline comments**: Explain non-obvious code with comments
- **Real-world patterns**: Use actual code from the codebase when possible
- **Avoid placeholders**: Use concrete examples (e.g., `userId: "abc123"` not `userId: "..."`)
- **Show errors**: Include error handling in examples when relevant

### Length and Conciseness
- **Target 300-500 words per section**: Break longer content into subsections
- **Remove redundancy**: Don't repeat what's in other sections
- **Cut unnecessary words**: "Use X" not "You should use X"
- **Combine related examples**: Multiple small examples can often be one
- **Use tables for comparisons**: Replace paragraphs of comparisons with tables

## Information Architecture

### Content Hierarchy
1. **Getting Started** - Quick setup and first success (15 min or less)
2. **Core Concepts** - Essential patterns and mental models (what, why)
3. **Architecture** - Technical details and design decisions (how it works)
4. **How-To Guides** - Task-oriented instructions (how to do X)
5. **Reference** - API documentation, package details (comprehensive reference)
6. **ADRs** - Historical decisions and rationale (context for contributors)

### Page Structure
```markdown
---
title: "Clear, Specific Title"
description: "One-sentence summary of what this page covers"
---

## Overview (Required)
2-3 sentences explaining what this is and why it matters.

## Quick Start (If applicable)
Minimal example to get started immediately.

## Main Content (Required)
Primary content organized with clear H2/H3 headings.

## Examples (If applicable)
Real-world usage patterns.

## Related Documentation (Required)
Links to related pages for further reading.
```

### Navigation Design
- **Top-level categories**: Maximum 5-7 main categories
- **Depth limit**: Maximum 3 levels deep (Category → Subcategory → Page)
- **Breadcrumb-friendly**: Each page should have clear ancestors
- **Cross-references**: Link related topics bidirectionally
- **Search-optimized**: Use keywords that users would search for

### Content Organization Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Single source of truth for each concept
- **Progressive complexity**: Simple → Intermediate → Advanced
- **Task-based guides**: Organize by what users want to accomplish
- **Reference vs tutorial**: Keep API reference separate from learning content
- **Modular content**: Each page should be independently useful

## README Files
High-level overview and quick reference only:
- **Keep READMEs lean**: Minimal content focused on getting started
- **Link to documentation site**: Point to detailed information rather than duplicating it
- **Follow standard structure**: Requirements → Quick Start → Links to docs
- **Avoid content duplication**: Don't replicate what exists in the documentation site

## Documentation Site

### Content Rules
- Keep content simple and technical (follow Writing Principles)
- Use generic wording (avoid product-specific branding)
- Structure: Core concepts → Architecture details → How-to guides → ADRs

### Linking Rules
- **Never link to README files from docs**: READMEs are repository artifacts
- **Always use markdown links for external URLs**
- **Keep navigation clean**: Focus on essential pages only

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Title and description are clear and accurate
- [ ] First paragraph explains what and why
- [ ] Code examples are tested and work
- [ ] No duplicate content exists elsewhere
- [ ] Related documentation links are present
- [ ] Headings use proper hierarchy (H2 → H3 → H4)
- [ ] Lists use consistent formatting
- [ ] No broken internal or external links
- [ ] Terminology is consistent throughout
- [ ] Length is appropriate (concise but complete)
