# ShadcnUI Rules

## Core Principles
- Install ShadcnUI components in `@workspace/ui` (packages/ui)
- Always import components from `@workspace/ui/components/*`, never directly from packages/ui
- Update the Tailwind preset or tokens in packages/ui (not per app)
- Application-specific components go in the Next.js app's `components` folder
- Hooks and utils must be collocated in the same directory as the component that uses them

## Installation Pattern
When generating UI code, always install ShadcnUI components in `@workspace/ui`:
- Components are installed in `packages/ui/src/components/`
- Each app has a `components.json` that points to:
  - `"utils": "@workspace/ui/lib/utils"`
  - `"ui": "@workspace/ui/components"`

## Import Patterns
Always import ShadcnUI components using the workspace alias:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@workspace/ui/components/button";
import { cn } from "@workspace/ui/lib/utils";
```

## Component Patterns
- Use the class-variance-authority (cva) pattern for variants
- Use the cn utility for merging class names

```tsx
import { cn } from "@workspace/ui/lib/utils";
import { cva } from "class-variance-authority";

const buttonVariants = cva(
  "rounded-md font-medium transition-colors",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-white hover:bg-primary/90",
        secondary: "bg-secondary text-white hover:bg-secondary/90"
      }
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default"
    }
  }
);
```

## Design System Organization
- Keep all core UI components in `@workspace/ui`
- Application-specific components go in the app's `components` folder
- Hooks and utils should be collocated with the components that use them (same directory)
