# React Rules

## Component Structure
- Separate UI and business logic into different components

## Props and State
- Follow the RORO (Receive an Object, Return an Object) pattern for props

## Rendering Optimization
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Use memo for pure components that render often
- Use useCallback for functions passed to child components
- Avoid creating new objects/arrays in render

## Component Composition
- Use children prop for flexible composition
- Extract shared logic into custom hooks

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Maintain proper color contrast

## Code Style
- **Enforce single-line if statements without brackets**: Use `if(condition) doSomething()` or `condition && doSomething()` for one-liners
- Multi-line if statements must use brackets
- Prefer one-liners for simple conditional logic
