# Google Cloud Deployment Option (Work in Progress)

This document describes the Google Cloud deployment option for the Vencura API, which provides enhanced control, security, and extensibility for production workloads.

## Overview

We're working on deploying the Vencura API to **Google Cloud Run** with infrastructure managed by **Pulumi** and automated via **GitHub Actions**. This deployment option is designed for production workloads that require:

- **Enhanced Security**: Private networking, VPC isolation, and fine-grained IAM controls
- **More Control**: Full control over infrastructure, scaling, and resource allocation
- **Avoid Cold Starts**: Persistent Cloud Run services with minimum instances
- **Extensibility**: Easy integration with other GCP services (Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, etc.)
- **Compliance**: Better support for enterprise security and compliance requirements

## Status

⚠️ **Work in Progress** - This deployment option is currently under development. The infrastructure code exists in `/infra/vencura` but is not yet fully integrated into the deployment pipeline.

**Important**: We are currently deploying everything on Vercel. We are NOT splitting the architecture now. This Google Cloud deployment option is documented as a potential future option ONLY if production security requirements demand it. See [Long-Term Vision: Split Architecture](#long-term-vision-split-architecture) below.

## Architecture

### Infrastructure Components

- **Cloud Run**: Serverless container platform for running the NestJS API
- **Cloud SQL Postgres**: Managed PostgreSQL database with private IP
- **VPC Network**: Dedicated VPC for network isolation
- **VPC Connector**: Serverless VPC access for Cloud Run to connect to Cloud SQL
- **Secret Manager**: Secure storage for API keys, encryption keys, and database credentials
- **Artifact Registry**: Docker image repository
- **Cloudflare**: DDoS protection, SSL/TLS termination, and custom domain management

### Network Topology

```
Internet → Cloudflare → Cloud Run → VPC Connector → Cloud SQL (Private IP)
```

All database connections use private IP addresses only, ensuring no public exposure.

## Why Google Cloud?

## Infrastructure as Code

The infrastructure is defined using **Pulumi** with TypeScript, providing:

- Type-safe infrastructure definitions
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Environment-based deployments (dev/prod)
- Preview changes before applying
- Rollback capabilities

See [ADR 010](../.adrs/010-vencura-infra-orchestration.md) for infrastructure orchestration details.

## Deployment Environments

- **Total**: ~$25-40/month

### Production Environment

- Cloud Run: Variable based on traffic
- Cloud SQL: ~$50-100/month (db-g1-small with HA)
- VPC Connector: ~$5/month
- **Total**: Variable, typically $100-200/month for moderate traffic

## Long-Term Vision: Split Architecture

**Important**: We are NOT splitting now. Everything stays on Vercel for the demo/development phase. This split architecture is documented as a potential future option ONLY if production security requirements demand it.

### Potential Split Architecture (For Future Production Security Needs)

**If production security requirements necessitate it, we may consider:**

**UI + Stateless API Glue on Vercel:**

- Next.js frontend applications
- Thin NestJS adapters for user auth, dashboards, webhooks, notifications
- Public API facades
- Leverages Vercel's excellent DX, edge network, and integrations

**Key-Custody & Signing Core on Google Cloud (Only if needed):**

- NestJS "signer" service on Cloud Run in private VPC (this deployment option)
- Keys in Cloud KMS/HSM (optionally MPC/threshold signing)
- Direct VPC egress control, firewall rules, VPC Flow Logs
- Cloud Armor WAF for public endpoints
- Org-wide controls (IAM conditions, service perimeters, CMEK)

**Edge Between the Two:**

- Single public API on GCP protected by mTLS/OAuth SA tokens
- IP allowlisting and Cloud Armor
- Vercel functions call GCP API; everything else stays private

### When This Split Might Be Considered

**Only if production security requirements demand:**

- Regulatory/compliance requirements for HSM-backed key custody
- Need for MPC/threshold signing workflows
- Requirement for private networking and strict egress control
- Enhanced audit trails and compliance beyond Vercel's capabilities
- Enterprise security requirements that exceed Vercel's offerings

**Vercel's Current Security (Sufficient for Demo/Development):**

- Mature platform security (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001)
- WAF/Firewall, deployment protection
- Automatic HTTPS, SSL/TLS
- Secure environment variables
- Access controls and audit logs

**Google Cloud Advantages (Only if needed for production):**

- HSM-backed keys & KMS with ECDSA support, rotation, IAM, audit logs
- Option for MPC/threshold flows with Confidential Space + KMS co-signers
- Private networking & egress control on Cloud Run
- VPC egress, firewall rules, VPC Flow Logs
- Cloud Armor WAF in front of public edges
- Org-wide controls (IAM conditions, service perimeters, CMEK)
- Standard supply-chain hardening (Artifact Registry, Binary Auth)

## Migration from Vercel

**Note**: We are currently staying on Vercel. This migration path is documented for potential future use if production security requirements demand it.

When ready to migrate to Google Cloud:

1. Set up infrastructure using Pulumi
2. Configure GitHub Actions workflows
3. Set up secrets in Secret Manager
4. Deploy to dev environment first
5. Test thoroughly
6. Deploy to production
7. Update DNS records to point to Cloud Run
