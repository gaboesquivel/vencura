# ADR 006: Linters and Code Formatters

## Context

We need to select linting and formatting tools for our monorepo that:

- Enforce code quality and consistency across all packages
- Support TypeScript, React, and NestJS
- Integrate well with our monorepo structure and tooling
- Provide good developer experience with IDE integration
- Work seamlessly with our build tools (Turbo, Next.js, NestJS)
- Have strong ecosystem support and community

## Considered Options

### Option A – ESLint + Prettier

Separate linting and formatting tools working together.

**Pros**

- Mature ecosystem with extensive plugin library
- Excellent support for TypeScript, React, Next.js, and NestJS
- Wide range of community-maintained rules and configurations
- Native support for Next.js with `@next/eslint-plugin-next`
- Strong integration with React and React Hooks
- Works seamlessly with NestJS patterns
- Turbo plugin for monorepo-specific linting
- Works well with pnpm workspaces
- Can share configurations across packages via workspace packages
- Excellent IDE integration (VS Code, WebStorm, etc.)
- Real-time linting and formatting feedback
- Clear separation: ESLint handles code quality, Prettier handles formatting
- `typescript-eslint` provides excellent TypeScript linting
- Type-aware linting rules
- Battle-tested in production environments
- Stable and reliable

**Cons**

- Requires two tools instead of one (ESLint + Prettier)
- Slightly more configuration overhead
- Need to ensure ESLint and Prettier don't conflict (solved with eslint-config-prettier)
- May be slower than Rust-based alternatives (acceptable trade-off)

### Option B – Biome

All-in-one linter and formatter written in Rust.

**Pros**

- All-in-one tool (linting and formatting)
- Very fast performance (written in Rust)
- Modern tooling

**Cons**

- Newer tool with smaller ecosystem
- Less community support and resources
- Fewer plugins and integrations
- Limited framework-specific rules (e.g., Next.js, NestJS)
- Less mature support for Next.js patterns
- Limited React-specific rules compared to ESLint
- No official NestJS support
- Smaller plugin ecosystem compared to ESLint
- Less tested with complex monorepo setups
- May have issues with workspace dependencies
- Less integration with Turbo and other monorepo tools
- Team has more experience with ESLint + Prettier
- Would require migrating existing ESLint configurations
- TypeScript support is newer and less mature

### Option C – ESLint only

Using ESLint for both linting and formatting.

**Pros**

- Single tool for both linting and formatting
- Simpler setup

**Cons**

- ESLint's formatting capabilities are limited
- Prettier provides better code formatting
- ESLint focuses on code quality, not formatting
- Prettier provides more consistent formatting
- Better handling of edge cases in formatting

### Option D – dprint

Fast formatter written in Rust.

**Pros**

- Very fast formatting performance
- Modern tooling

**Cons**

- Only handles formatting, not linting
- Would still need ESLint for code quality
- Less mature ecosystem compared to Prettier
- Smaller community and fewer resources
- Less integration with existing tooling
- Fewer IDE extensions and plugins
- Less tested with monorepo setups

## Decision

We will use **ESLint + Prettier** for linting and formatting.

**Main reasons:**

- Mature ecosystem with extensive plugin library and excellent support for TypeScript, React, Next.js, and NestJS
- Native support for Next.js with `@next/eslint-plugin-next` and Turbo plugin for monorepo-specific linting
- Works well with pnpm workspaces and can share configurations across packages via workspace packages
- Clear separation of concerns: ESLint handles code quality, Prettier handles formatting
- Excellent IDE integration with real-time feedback and type-aware linting rules via `typescript-eslint`

## Notes

- Biome may be reconsidered in the future as it matures and gains better framework support
- ESLint + Prettier continues to evolve with new features and improvements
- Consider migrating to Biome if it gains better Next.js and NestJS support
- Monitor Biome's ecosystem growth and community adoption
