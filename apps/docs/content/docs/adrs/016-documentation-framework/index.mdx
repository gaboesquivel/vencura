title: "ADR 016: Documentation Framework Migration to Fumadocs"
description: "Decision to migrate documentation to Fumadocs for Next.js App Router integration, MDX support, and improved developer experience with structured content."
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a Next.js-native documentation framework that:

- Works seamlessly with our Next.js App Router architecture
- Supports MDX for content authoring
- Provides good developer experience out of the box
- Is open source and self-hostable
- Supports AI-assisted documentation workflows (we use AI tools extensively)

We initially had documentation content in `__dev/pages/` directory and needed to migrate to a proper documentation framework integrated with our docs app. Note: This `__dev/` directory is different from the current `_dev/` directory which contains internal dev tools (infra scripts, templates).

## Decision

We migrated all documentation content from `__dev/pages/` to `apps/docs/content/docs/` using **Fumadocs** as our documentation framework.

### Migration Details

- Converted all MDX files from `__dev/pages/` to fumadocs format with proper frontmatter
- Created nested `meta.json` files for navigation structure
- Preserved directory structure (apps, packages, guides)
- All files now include `title` and `description` frontmatter

## Rationale

### Why Fumadocs

- **Next.js App Router native**: Built specifically for Next.js App Router, fits our architecture perfectly
- **Composable architecture**: Set of libraries that compose into any React/Next app, not an opinionated site generator
- **MDX support**: Full MDX support with frontmatter and custom components
- **Modern UX**: Used by projects like shadcn/ui and Million.js, with strong search and extensibility
- **AI-friendly**: Better structured for AI-assisted documentation workflows
- **Open source**: MIT-licensed, self-hostable, fully customizable

### Migration Benefits

- **Structured content**: Proper frontmatter and meta.json files enable better navigation
- **Type safety**: Fumadocs provides type-safe content access
- **Better DX**: Cleaner file structure, easier to maintain and extend
- **Consistent format**: All documentation follows the same structure and conventions

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ Unified documentation structure across all content
- ✅ Better navigation with meta.json files
- ✅ Type-safe content access via fumadocs source API
- ✅ Easier to extend with custom components and features
- ✅ Better integration with Next.js App Router

### Negative

- ❌ Migration effort required (one-time cost)
- ❌ Need to maintain frontmatter consistency across files

### Neutral

- Content structure preserved, only format changed
- `__dev/pages/` directory kept for reference (note: different from current `_dev/` directory)

## Implementation

### File Structure

```
apps/docs/content/docs/
├── index.mdx
├── meta.json
├── getting-started/index.mdx
├── architecture/index.mdx
├── environment/index.mdx
├── deployment/index.mdx
├── tooling/index.mdx
├── mcp-servers/index.mdx
├── vercel-portability/index.mdx
├── google-cloud/index.mdx
├── dynamic-integration/index.mdx
├── apps/
│   ├── meta.json
│   ├── api/index.mdx
│   └── web/index.mdx
└── packages/
    ├── meta.json
    ├── core/index.mdx
    ├── react/index.mdx
    └── ui/index.mdx
```

### Frontmatter Format

All MDX files include:

```mdx
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "Page description"
---
```

### Navigation Structure

- Root `meta.json` for top-level navigation
- Nested `meta.json` files in `apps/` and `packages/` directories
- Supports hierarchical navigation structure

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep content in `__dev/pages/`

**Rejected because:**
- No integration with documentation framework
- No structured navigation
- Harder to maintain and extend

### Alternative 2: Use Nextra

**Rejected because:**
- More opinionated, less composable
- Required more configuration and debugging
- Less modern UX direction

### Alternative 3: Use Mintlify / GitBook

**Rejected because:**
- Hosted, proprietary solutions
- We need open source, self-hostable, fully customizable
