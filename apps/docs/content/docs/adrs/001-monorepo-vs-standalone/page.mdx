# 0001. Monorepo vs Standalone Repositories

## Context

The project involves multiple front-end applications and backend services that share UI components, TypeScript types, and development tooling.  
Managing these pieces in separate repositories makes synchronization harder and slows down iteration.

We need an architecture that:

- Promotes **code reuse** across UI and backend apps.
- Provides **shared tooling and consistent standards** (linting, formatting, build scripts).
- Simplifies dependency management and CI/CD pipelines.
- Keeps developer experience consistent across the codebase.

## Considered Options

### Option A – Monorepo (Turborepo)

All applications and packages coexist in one repository (`apps/*`, `packages/*`), orchestrated by Turborepo.

**Pros**

- Shared UI components, types, and config across apps.
- Unified tooling and faster CI/CD via Turborepo caching.
- Easier developer onboarding and dependency upgrades.
- Consistent standards enforced project-wide.

**Cons**

- Slightly higher repo complexity and workspace management overhead.
- Requires clear ownership boundaries to avoid tight coupling.

### Option B – Standalone Repositories

Each app or service lives in its own repo, communicating via published packages or APIs.

**Pros**

- Clean separation of concerns and clearer version boundaries.
- Easier for teams to work independently with isolated pipelines.

**Cons**

- Harder to keep shared dependencies synchronized.
- Requires multiple CI/CD setups.
- Repeated tooling configuration and code duplication.

## Decision

Adopt a **Monorepo architecture** using **Turborepo** to orchestrate builds and caching.  
Shared components, utilities, and standards will live under `packages/`, while each app resides under `apps/`.

**Main reasons:**

- Enables code reuse across UI and backend apps through shared components and types
- Unified tooling and consistent standards across all projects
- Faster CI/CD via Turborepo caching
- Simplified dependency management and easier developer onboarding
