This document describes how we use Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in our development workflow with Cursor Composer 1.

## Overview

MCP servers extend AI assistants (like Cursor's Composer 1) with specialized capabilities, allowing them to interact with external services and tools directly. This enables more powerful AI-assisted development workflows.

All MCP servers are configured to use `pnpm dlx` for command execution, consistent with our project's package manager choice.

## Configured MCP Servers

Our project uses the following MCP servers, configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`:

### 1. Shadcn MCP

**Purpose**: UI component management using shadcn/ui

**Capabilities**:

- Search and browse shadcn/ui components
- Add components to the project
- View component examples and documentation

**Authentication**: Uses local CLI command execution (no API key required)

**Usage**: When working with UI components, the AI can search for and add shadcn/ui components directly.

### 2. v0.dev MCP

**Purpose**: UI design and component generation

**Capabilities**:

- Generate React components from descriptions
- Access v0.dev's component library
- Create UI designs and layouts

**Authentication**: Requires `V0_API_KEY` environment variable

**Usage**: Ask the AI to generate UI components or designs, and it will use v0.dev's capabilities.

### 3. GitHub MCP

**Purpose**: GitHub repository management and operations

**Capabilities**:

- Read repository files and structure
- Create and manage issues
- Manage pull requests
- Access repository metadata

**Authentication**: Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable

**Usage**: The AI can interact with GitHub repositories, read code, and manage issues/PRs.

### 4. Vercel MCP

**Purpose**: Vercel deployment and project management

**Capabilities**:

- List and manage deployments
- Get deployment details and build logs
- Manage domains and check availability
- Access project information
- Create shareable links for protected deployments
- Fetch content from Vercel deployments

**Authentication**: Requires `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` environment variable

**Usage**: The AI can deploy projects, check deployment status, view build logs, and manage Vercel resources.

#### Vercel's 2024 Backend Improvements

Vercel has made significant improvements in 2024 to support backend frameworks like NestJS:

- **Zero-configuration NestJS support**: Deploy NestJS applications without manual configuration
- **Fluid Compute with Active CPU pricing**: Automatic scaling with pay-for-what-you-use pricing model
- **Reduced cold starts**: Significantly improved cold start times for backend APIs
- **Native support for long-running applications**: Better support for traditional backend APIs

**Note**: Vercel is a deployment convenience - the stack remains portable to any Linux platform. Our default approach avoids Vercel-specific features to maintain portability, but we can leverage them pragmatically when scaling/performance needs justify it from a product/business perspective.

## Using MCP Servers with Cursor Composer 1

### Setup

1. Ensure environment variables are set:
   - `V0_API_KEY` (for v0.dev)
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` (for GitHub)
   - `VERCEL_API_TOKEN` (for Vercel)

2. MCP servers are automatically loaded when Cursor starts

3. In Composer 1, you can reference MCP capabilities in your prompts

### Example Prompts

**Using Shadcn MCP**:

```
Add a shadcn/ui button component to the login page
```

**Using v0.dev MCP**:

```
Generate a dashboard layout component using v0.dev
```

**Using GitHub MCP**:

```
Check the latest issues in the repository
```

**Using Vercel MCP**:

```
Deploy this project to Vercel
Show me the build logs for the latest deployment
Check if mydomain.com is available
List all deployments for the vencura-api project
Get details about the production deployment
Create a shareable link for the protected preview deployment
```

## Authentication Setup

### Getting API Keys

#### V0_API_KEY

Get from [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) account settings.

#### GITHUB_TOKEN

Create a personal access token at [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

#### VERCEL_API_TOKEN

**Step-by-step instructions:**

1. **Navigate to Vercel Account Settings:**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
   - Or: Go to https://vercel.com → Click your profile icon → Settings → Tokens

2. **Create a new token:**
   - Click the **"Create Token"** button
   - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Cursor MCP" or "Development")
   - Choose an expiration period (or select "No Expiration" for long-term use)
   - Click **"Create"**

3. **Copy the token immediately:**
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Copy the token right away - it will only be shown once
   - If you lose it, you'll need to create a new token

4. **Security notes:**
   - Never commit the token to version control
   - Treat it like a password - keep it secure
   - You can revoke it anytime from the same tokens page
   - Consider creating separate tokens for different purposes/environments

### Setting Environment Variables

Add these to your shell profile (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.) or use a `.env` file:

**For your current shell session:**

```bash
export V0_API_KEY=your_v0_api_key
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
export VERCEL_API_TOKEN=your_vercel_api_token
```

**To make it permanent (add to your shell profile):**

For Zsh (default on macOS):

```bash
echo 'export VERCEL_API_TOKEN=your_vercel_api_token' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

For Bash:

```bash
echo 'export VERCEL_API_TOKEN=your_vercel_api_token' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Verify the token is set:**

```bash
echo $VERCEL_API_TOKEN
```

**Important**: After setting the `VERCEL_API_TOKEN`, restart Cursor so the MCP server can authenticate properly. The Vercel MCP server will not work until the token is set and Cursor is restarted.

## Best Practices

1. **Use MCP servers for repetitive tasks**: Let the AI handle deployment, component management, and repository operations
2. **Verify MCP actions**: Always review what the AI is doing, especially for deployments and repository changes
3. **Keep API keys secure**: Never commit API keys to version control
4. **Use appropriate MCP for the task**: Each MCP server has specific capabilities - use the right one for the job
5. **Portability first**: When using Vercel MCP, remember our portable-by-default principle - avoid vendor-specific features unless justified
6. **Combine MCP servers**: Use multiple MCP servers together for complex workflows (e.g., GitHub + Vercel for deployment workflows)
7. **Test deployments**: Always verify deployments work correctly after using Vercel MCP
8. **Document workflows**: When establishing new MCP-based workflows, document them for team reference
