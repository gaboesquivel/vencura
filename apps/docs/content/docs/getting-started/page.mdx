Vencura is a custodial wallet platform - the Venmo of wallets. A full-stack monorepo featuring a multichain custodial wallet API, AI-powered chatbot, and Mathler game. Built with portability in mind - deploy anywhere without vendor lock-in.

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

## Development

```bash
# Run all apps in development mode (with local Anvil blockchain)
pnpm dev:local

# Run all apps in staging mode (with testnets)
pnpm dev:staging

# Build all apps
pnpm build
```

## Quick Start

1. Copy example env files for each app:
   ```bash
   cp apps/api/.env-example apps/api/.env
   cp apps/web/.env-example apps/web/.env
   ```
2. Fill in your values (Dynamic environment ID, API token, etc.) in `.env` files
3. Start local development: `pnpm dev:local`

## Environment Setup

This monorepo uses environment-specific configuration files. See [Environment Strategy](/docs/environment) for detailed configuration.

**Environment Files:**

- **`.env`** - Sensitive data (API keys, tokens, secrets) - **NEVER COMMIT**
- **`.env.development`** - Development configuration (committed, non-sensitive) - Local Anvil blockchain
- **`.env.staging`** - Staging configuration (committed, non-sensitive) - Testnets
- **`.env.production`** - Production configuration (committed, non-sensitive) - Mainnet

## Testing

```bash
# Test API (requires Foundry for Anvil local blockchain)
cd apps/api && pnpm run test:e2e
```

The API uses a **blackbox testing strategy** with local chains for automation.
