## Overview

We use **pnpm** for package management and a **hybrid Biome + ESLint** setup. Biome handles fast formatting and stylistic rules, while ESLint focuses on correctness rules for TypeScript, React, and Next.js.

## Package Manager: pnpm

**pnpm** is our package manager of choice for monorepo reliability:

- ✅ **Workspace support** - Correctly hoists and resolves dependencies across workspace packages
- ✅ **Monorepo maturity** - Battle-tested with Next.js, Fastify, and Turborepo
- ✅ **Symlink-based** - Proper node_modules structure for workspace packages
- ✅ **Production stability** - Reliable builds without workarounds
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** - Same behavior in development and production

### Why pnpm over alternatives?

- **vs npm/yarn** - Better workspace dependency resolution
- **vs Bun** - More mature monorepo support and production stability

## Linting & Formatting: Hybrid Biome + ESLint

We use a **hybrid approach** that combines the best of both tools:

- **Biome** - Fast formatting and stylistic rules (Rust-based)
- **ESLint** - Correctness rules for TypeScript, React, Next.js

### Clear Separation of Concerns

  ESLint --> Validated[Validated Code]
  Formatted --> CI[CI/CD Pipeline]
  Validated --> CI
```

### Biome Responsibilities

**Biome** handles (extremely fast, Rust-based):

- ✅ **Code formatting** - All formatting concerns (faster than Prettier)
- ✅ **Stylistic linting** - Import sorting, unused variables, style preferences
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** - Auto-formatting of staged files

### ESLint Responsibilities

**ESLint** handles (focused on correctness):

- ✅ **TypeScript rules** - Type safety and correctness
- ✅ **React rules** - React and React Hooks best practices
- ✅ **Next.js rules** - Framework-specific rules via `@next/eslint-plugin-next`
- ✅ **Fastify rules** - Backend code quality

### Workflow

```bash
# Format code (extremely fast)
pnpm lint:biome:fix

# Lint with Biome (formatting and stylistic checks)
pnpm lint:biome

# Lint with ESLint (correctness checks)
pnpm lint:eslint

# Fix all (runs both Biome and ESLint fixes)
pnpm lint:fix
```

### Pre-commit & CI/CD

- **Pre-commit hooks** - Biome auto-formats staged files
- **CI/CD** - Both tools run for quality assurance
- **Fast feedback** - Minimal waiting time, excellent developer experience

## Why Hybrid Approach?

### Maximum Speed

- **Biome** is written in Rust, providing extremely fast formatting
- **ESLint** focuses only on correctness (faster execution without formatting)

### Best of Both Worlds

- **Biome's speed** for formatting and stylistic checks
- **ESLint's mature ecosystem** for framework-specific rules

### Clear Boundaries

- **Biome** = formatting/stylistic
- **ESLint** = correctness
- No conflicts, no confusion

## Configuration

### Biome Configuration

Biome handles all formatting and basic linting:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.9.4/schema.json",
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

### ESLint Configuration

ESLint configured to disable checks Biome handles:

- Uses ESLint 9 flat config format
- Focused on TypeScript, React, Next.js, Fastify rules
- No formatting rules (Biome handles those)
