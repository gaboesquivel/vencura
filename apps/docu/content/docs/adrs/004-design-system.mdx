description: "Decision to use Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS for consistent UI components, rapid prototyping with v0, and full component ownership without vendor lock-in."
---

## Context

We need to establish a design system approach for our frontend applications that:

- Provides consistent UI components across applications
- Enables rapid prototyping and iteration
- Integrates well with our chosen frontend framework (Next.js)
- Supports modern design patterns and accessibility
- Allows for easy customization and theming

## Considered Options

### Option A – Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS

Copy-paste component library with Tailwind.

**Pros**

- Leveraging v0 for prototyping was a key factor in picking Next.js
- v0 generates Next.js + Shadcn/ui components, enabling fast iteration
- Seamless workflow from AI-generated prototypes to production code
- Components are copied into the codebase, giving full ownership
- No dependency on external component library versions
- Easy to customize and modify components as needed
- No vendor lock-in or breaking changes from library updates
- Utility-first CSS approach enables rapid styling
- Consistent design tokens and spacing system
- Built on Radix UI primitives (accessible by default)
- Well-tested components with good defaults
- Components can be shared through `@repo/ui` package
- Works seamlessly with Next.js and our monorepo structure

**Cons**

- Need to manually update components when Shadcn/ui releases new versions
- Some learning curve for Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Initial setup requires configuring Tailwind and component structure

### Option B – Material-UI / Mantine

Full component libraries.

**Pros**

- Comprehensive component library
- Well-documented
- Large community

**Cons**

- Harder to customize beyond the library's design system
- More opinionated styling that may not match our brand
- Larger bundle sizes with unused components
- External dependency that can introduce breaking changes
- Less control over component implementation
- Potential version conflicts in monorepo

### Option C – Radix UI + Custom Styling

Headless components with custom styling.

**Pros**

- Full control over styling
- Accessible primitives from Radix UI
- Flexible customization

**Cons**

- Requires building all styling from scratch
- More time-consuming than using pre-styled components
- Less rapid prototyping capabilities
- Harder to maintain consistent design patterns
- More effort required for design system documentation

### Option D – Custom Component Library

Building everything from scratch.

**Pros**

- Complete control over all aspects
- No external dependencies
- Custom to our needs

**Cons**

- Building everything from scratch is time-consuming
- More code to maintain and test
- Slower time to market
- Shadcn/ui provides a solid foundation to build upon

## Decision

We will use **Shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS** as our design system foundation.

### TLDR: Comparison Table

| Feature | Shadcn/ui + Tailwind ✅ | Material-UI/Mantine | Radix UI + Custom | Custom Library |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **v0 integration** | ✅ Seamless | ❌ Limited | ❌ Limited | ❌ None |
| **Component ownership** | ✅ Full (copy-paste) | ❌ External dependency | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| **Customization** | ✅ Easy | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full control | ✅ Full control |
| **Bundle size** | ✅ Small (tree-shakeable) | ⚠️ Larger | ✅ Small | ✅ Small |
| **Rapid prototyping** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Slower | ❌ Slow |
| **Accessibility** | ✅ Radix primitives | ✅ Good | ✅ Radix primitives | ⚠️ Manual |
| **Vendor lock-in** | ✅ None | ❌ Yes | ✅ None | ✅ None |
| **Maintenance** | ⚠️ Manual updates | ✅ Library updates | ⚠️ All custom | ⚠️ All custom |
| **Time to market** | ✅ Fast | ✅ Fast | ⚠️ Slower | ❌ Slow |

**Main reasons:**

- Leveraging v0 for prototyping was a key factor in picking Next.js; v0 generates Next.js + Shadcn/ui components
- Copy-paste philosophy gives full ownership of components with no external dependency versioning
- Easy to customize and modify components as needed without vendor lock-in
- Built on Radix UI primitives (accessible by default) with well-tested components
- Works seamlessly with Next.js and our monorepo structure through `@repo/ui` package

## Notes

- v0's integration with Next.js + Shadcn/ui was a significant factor in choosing Next.js
- Components can be customized extensively while maintaining the base structure
- Consider contributing improvements back to Shadcn/ui when appropriate
- Monitor Shadcn/ui updates for new components and improvements

### MCP Server Integration

MCP servers complement the v0 workflow for component discovery and installation:

- **shadcnui-official**: Provides canonical component reference for variants, props, and single primitives
- **shadcnui-jpisnice-react**: Provides React blocks and templates for complete page implementations
- MCP servers work alongside v0, enabling both AI-generated prototypes and direct component discovery
- **Note:** `shadcnui-jpisnice-react-native` exists for future React Native support but is not included in the current React workflow
