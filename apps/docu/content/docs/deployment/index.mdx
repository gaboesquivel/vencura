This section covers deployment strategies, CI/CD setup, and platform-specific configurations.

## GitHub Flow

This project follows **GitHub Flow** for continuous deployment:

1. **Create feature branch** - Branch from `main` for new features
2. **Make changes** - Develop and test locally
3. **Open pull request** - Create PR when ready for review
4. **Automated checks** - GitHub Actions runs tests, linting, security scans
5. **Code review** - CodeRabbit + human review
6. **Merge to main** - Merge when checks pass and approved
7. **Automatic deployment** - Deploy to staging/production automatically

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Continuous deployment - Every merge triggers deployment
- ✅ Automated quality gates - Tests, linting, security checks
- ✅ AI-powered reviews - CodeRabbit provides immediate feedback
- ✅ Preview environments - Test changes before merging

## CI/CD Pipeline

Automated workflows enforce quality standards:

- **CodeRabbit** - AI-powered code reviews on every PR
- **GitHub Actions** - Tests, type checking, linting, security scans
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Local quality checks (formatting, secrets detection)

See [GitHub Actions](/docs/deployment/github-actions) for CI workflow configuration.

## Deployment Platforms

### Vercel (Recommended for Development)

Fast deployment with preview environments for every PR. Great for rapid iteration and frontend apps.

See [Vercel Deployment](/docs/deployment/vercel) for details.

### Google Cloud / AWS (Production)

Enterprise deployment options with zero code changes required. Great for compliance, security, and scale.

See [Portability Strategy](/docs/architecture/portability) for migration paths.

## Publishing Packages

Internal packages can be published to npm using the dual-mode export strategy.

See [Publishing Packages](/docs/deployment/publishing) for details.
