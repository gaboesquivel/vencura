GitHub Actions workflows automate quality checks on every pull request and push to main.

## Workflows

### CI Workflow

Tests, type checking, and linting on every PR:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (simplified)
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 10.28.0
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm lint
      - run: pnpm checktypes
      - run: pnpm test
```

### Security Workflow

Security scans on every PR:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml (simplified)
name: Security

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Gitleaks scan
        uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
      - name: OSV Scanner
        uses: google/osv-scanner-action/osv-scanner-action@v1.8.5
```

### Package Tests

Tests for specific packages:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/packages-test.yml (simplified)
name: Packages Tests

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test-packages:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm --filter @repo/error test
      - run: pnpm --filter @repo/utils test
```

## CodeRabbit Integration

CodeRabbit automatically reviews pull requests using AI. Configuration is in `.coderabbit.yaml`:

```yaml
# .coderabbit.yaml (simplified)
language: en-US
reviews:
  auto_review: true
  high_level_summary: true
```

See the complete `.coderabbit.yaml` in the repository root for full configuration.

## Pre-commit Hooks

Local quality checks run before each commit:

```json
// package.json (simplified)
{
  "simple-git-hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "pnpm run hooks:pre-commit"
  }
}
```

Pre-commit hooks check:
1. **File blocking** - Prevents committing sensitive files (`.env`, `*.pem`, etc.)
2. **Secret scanning** - Scans staged files with gitleaks
3. **Formatting** - Runs Biome formatter on staged files

## Best Practices

1. **Run checks locally** - Fix issues before pushing
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   pnpm checktypes
   pnpm test
   ```

2. **Review CodeRabbit suggestions** - Learn from AI feedback and iterate

3. **Keep workflows fast** - Use caching and parallel jobs

4. **Test before merge** - Ensure all checks pass before merging

5. **Monitor CI failures** - Fix broken workflows immediately

## Workflow Files

All workflows are in `.github/workflows/`:
- `api-test.yml` - API tests
- `lint.yml` - Linting checks
- `packages-test.yml` - Package tests
- `security.yml` - Security scans
- `web-test.yml` - Web app tests
