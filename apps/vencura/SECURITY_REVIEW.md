# Vencura Security Review Report

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Reviewer**: Security Assessment  
**Scope**: Complete system security review (Infrastructure, Application, Deployment, Frontend, Architecture)

## Executive Summary

This security review assessed the Vencura custodial wallet system across infrastructure, application code, deployment workflows, frontend, and architecture. The system demonstrates strong security fundamentals with AES-256-GCM encryption, Dynamic Labs authentication, and zero-trust network architecture. However, several critical and high-priority security issues were identified that require immediate attention, particularly around public access controls, secret management in CI/CD, and input validation.

**Overall Security Posture**: Good foundation with critical gaps requiring immediate remediation.

### Risk Summary

- **Critical**: 1 issue (1 fixed ✅)
- **High**: 5 issues (2 fixed ✅, 1 accepted, 2 remaining)
- **Medium**: 8 issues
- **Low**: 6 issues

**Note**: Public access to Cloud Run is intentional - Cloudflare provides DDoS protection in front of the service.

### CRIT-002: Secrets Exposed in Ephemeral PR Deployment Environment Variables ✅ FIXED

**Location**: `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml:82-176`

**Issue**: Ephemeral PR deployments expose sensitive secrets as plaintext environment variables in Cloud Run service configuration.

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Secrets are now stored in Secret Manager and referenced via `--set-secrets` instead of `--set-env-vars`.

```yaml
--set-env-vars "PORT=3000,DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID=${{ secrets.DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID }},DYNAMIC_API_TOKEN=${{ secrets.DYNAMIC_API_TOKEN }},ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=${{ secrets.ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL }},ENCRYPTION_KEY=${{ secrets.ENCRYPTION_KEY }},USE_PGLITE=true"
```

**Impact**:

- Secrets visible in Cloud Run service configuration (readable by anyone with Cloud Run viewer permissions)
- Secrets visible in deployment logs
- Secrets exposed in PR comments/deployment URLs
- Violates secret management best practices

**Recommendation**:

- Use Secret Manager for all secrets, even in ephemeral deployments
- Reference secrets via `--set-secrets` instead of `--set-env-vars`
- Create temporary secrets in Secret Manager for PR deployments
- Clean up secrets after PR closure

**Remediation**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

- Temporary secrets are created in Secret Manager with naming pattern `vencura-pr-{number}-{secret-name}`
- Secrets are referenced via `--set-secrets` instead of `--set-env-vars`
- Secrets are automatically cleaned up when PR is closed
- CI/CD service account granted `roles/secretmanager.admin` for managing temporary secrets

**Implementation Details**:

- Secrets created in "Create temporary secrets for PR deployment" step
- Cloud Run default compute service account granted access to temporary secrets
- Cleanup step deletes both Cloud Run service and temporary secrets on PR close
- Service account permissions updated in `infra/vencura/lib/service-accounts.ts`

**Priority**: Immediate ✅ RESOLVED

## High Priority Findings

### HIGH-001: Missing Input Validation on Ethereum Address Format ✅ FIXED

**Location**: `apps/vencura/src/wallet/dto/send-transaction.dto.ts`

**Issue**: The `to` field in `SendTransactionDto` only validated that it's a non-empty string, but didn't validate Ethereum address format.

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Ethereum address format validation added using `@Matches()` decorator.

**Remediation**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

- Added `@Matches(/^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/)` decorator to validate Ethereum address format
- Validates 0x-prefixed 40-character hexadecimal addresses
- Provides clear error message for invalid addresses

**Priority**: High ✅ RESOLVED

---

### HIGH-002: Missing Rate Limiting ✅ FIXED

**Location**: Application-wide

**Issue**: No rate limiting was implemented on API endpoints, particularly sensitive operations like wallet creation, signing, and transaction sending.

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Rate limiting implemented using `@nestjs/throttler` with endpoint-specific limits.

**Remediation**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

- Installed and configured `@nestjs/throttler`
- Global rate limit: 100 requests per minute for general endpoints
- Wallet creation: 10 requests per minute
- Sign operations: 30 requests per minute
- Transaction sending: 20 requests per minute
- Rate limiting applied globally via `ThrottlerGuard`
- **Note**: Cloudflare provides additional DDoS protection in front of the service

**Priority**: High ✅ RESOLVED

---

### HIGH-003: No Network Parameter Validation

**Location**: `apps/vencura/src/wallet/dto/create-wallet.dto.ts`

**Issue**: Network parameter is optional and not validated against allowed values.

```typescript
export class CreateWalletDto {
  @ApiProperty({
    example: 'arbitrum-sepolia',
    description: 'Blockchain network',
  })
  network?: string; // ⚠️ No validation
}
```

**Impact**:

- Invalid network values could cause errors
- Potential for injection attacks
- No protection against unsupported networks

**Recommendation**:

- Add validation to ensure network is from allowed list
- Use enum or `@IsIn()` decorator
- Default to 'arbitrum-sepolia' if not provided

**Remediation**:

```typescript
import { IsOptional, IsIn } from 'class-validator';

@IsOptional()
@IsIn(['arbitrum-sepolia'], {
  message: 'Network must be arbitrum-sepolia'
})
network?: string = 'arbitrum-sepolia';
```

**Priority**: High (1 week)

---

### HIGH-004: Missing CORS Configuration ✅ ACCEPTED

**Location**: `apps/vencura/src/main.ts`

**Issue**: No CORS configuration visible in the application.

**Status**: ✅ **ACCEPTED** - CORS left open intentionally for now. Will be configured as needed.

**Decision**: CORS configuration deferred. The application will handle CORS requirements as they arise during frontend integration.

**Priority**: High ✅ ACCEPTED (Deferred)

---

### HIGH-005: No Request Size Limits

**Location**: Application-wide

**Issue**: No explicit request body size limits configured, which could allow:

### MED-004: Error Messages May Leak Information

**Location**: `apps/vencura/src/wallet/wallet.service.ts`, `apps/vencura/src/auth/auth.service.ts`

**Issue**: Some error messages may provide information that could be useful to attackers.

**Examples**:

- "Dynamic configuration is not set" - reveals internal configuration
- "ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL is not set" - reveals environment variable names

**Impact**:

- Information disclosure
- Potential for reconnaissance
- Helps attackers understand system architecture

**Recommendation**:

- Use generic error messages in production
- Log detailed errors server-side only
- Don't expose internal configuration details

**Remediation**:

```typescript
// Instead of:
throw new Error('ARBITRUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL is not set');

// Use:
throw new InternalServerErrorException('Configuration error');
// Log detailed error server-side
```

**Priority**: Medium (1 month)

---

### MED-005: No Request ID/Tracing

**Location**: Application-wide

**Issue**: No request ID or tracing implemented, making it difficult to:

- Track requests across services

app.use(
  helmet({
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      },
    },
    hsts: {
      maxAge: 31536000,
      includeSubDomains: true,
      preload: true,
    },
  }),
);
```

**Priority**: Medium (1 month)

---

### MED-007: No Separate GCP Projects Enforced

**Location**: Infrastructure configuration

**Issue**: While the infrastructure supports separate projects, there's no enforcement or validation that dev and prod use different projects.

**Impact**:

- Risk of deploying to wrong environment
- Potential for cross-environment access
- Configuration errors could affect production

**Recommendation**:

- Add validation in Pulumi config
- Enforce project separation via organization policies
- Add checks in CI/CD workflows

**Priority**: Medium (1 month)

---

### MED-008: Ephemeral Deployment Cleanup May Fail Silently

**Location**: `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml:196-203`

**Issue**: Cleanup of ephemeral deployments uses `|| true`, which means failures are silently ignored.

```yaml
gcloud run services delete $SERVICE_NAME \
--region ${{ env.REGION }} \
--quiet || true # ⚠️ Silently ignores failures
```

**Impact**:

- Failed cleanups may leave resources running
- Cost implications
- Resource leakage

**Recommendation**:

- Log cleanup failures
- Alert on cleanup failures
- Implement retry logic
- Monitor for orphaned resources

**Priority**: Medium (1 month)

---
